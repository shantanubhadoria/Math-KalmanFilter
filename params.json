The key to Kalman filters are two sensors\r\nwith different kind of accuracy issues in each. Sensor A or the state sensor might give in-accurate value\r\nfor a measurement on the whole but it doesn't drift. Sensor B or delta sensor gives gives much more accurate \r\nrate of change in value(or delta) but it drifts over time due to its small inaccuracies as it only measures\r\nrate of change in value and not the actual value. Kalman filter uses this knowledge to fuse results from both\r\nsensors to give a state value which is more accurate than state value received from any of these filters\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAn example of application for this is calculating orientation of objects using Gyroscopes and Accelerometers.\r\n\r\nWhile Accelerometer is usually used to measure gravity it can be used to measure the inclination of a body \r\nwith respect to the surface of earth along the x and y axis(not z axis as Z axis is usually facing the \r\nopposite direction as the force of gravity) by measuring the direction in which the force of gravity is \r\napplied.\r\n\r\nGyroscope measures the rate of rotation about one or all the axis of a body. while it gives fairly accurate \r\nestimation of the angular velocity, if we use it to calculate the current inclination based on the starting \r\ninclination and the angular velocity, there is a lot of drift, which means the gyroscope error will accumulate \r\nover time as we calculate newer angles based on previous angle and angular velocity and the error in angular \r\nvelocity piles on.\r\n\r\nA real life example of how Kalman filter works is while driving on a highway in a car. If you take the time \r\npassed since when your started driving and your estimated average speed every hour and use it to calculate \r\nthe distance you have traveled your calculation will become more inaccurate as you drive on.\r\n\r\nThis is drift in value. However if you watch each milestone and calculate your current position using milestone\r\ndata and your speed since the last milestone your result will be much more accurate. That is approximately close\r\n\r\n    to how Kalman filter works.\r\n\r\n# ATTRIBUTES\r\n\r\n## qAngle\r\n\r\n    * default: 0.001 \r\n\r\n## qBias\r\n\r\n    * default: 0.003\r\n\r\n## rMeasure \r\n\r\n    * default: 0.03\r\n\r\n## bias\r\n\r\n    * starting value(default): 0\r\n    * recalculated(optimised) at each new sensor reading.\r\n\r\n## covariance\r\n\r\nThis is the covariance matrix, it is stored as a 2d array ref\r\n \\* starting value(default): \\[\\[0,0\\],\\[0,0\\]\\]\r\n \\* recalculated(optimised) at each new sensor reading.\r\n\r\n## angle \r\n\r\nCalculated angle\r\n\r\n# METHODS\r\n\r\n## getAngle\r\n\r\nCalculate new state based on observed reading from state sensor, delta sensor and time elapsed since last reading.\r\n\r\n## BADGES\r\n\r\n# SUPPORT\r\n\r\n## Bugs / Feature Requests\r\n\r\nPlease report any bugs or feature requests through github at \r\n[https://github.com/shantanubhadoria/perl-math-kalmanfilter/issues](https://github.com/shantanubhadoria/perl-math-kalmanfilter/issues).\r\nYou will be notified automatically of any progress on your issue.\r\n\r\n## Source Code\r\n\r\nThis is open source software.
